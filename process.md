# OneRestroomAway Process Specification

## How will you communicate with teammates you depend on? Describe specific tools or contexts.

- We have been using Slack for communication.
- @channel will be used to contact all members of the team
    - This means every team member must react or reply to the message within 18 hours
- @person_name will be used to contact a specific member on the team, this can be on the team channel or through private message. This person must reply to the message within 18 hours.
- In case the team member does not reply within 18 hours or in an urgent situation, use Facebook Messenger to contact the person.
- Everyone has Slack notifications turned on to ensure we can all be reached. Facebook Messenger will be used as a backup messaging platform.

## What coordination and planning practices will you follow? Identify daily scrums, sprint planning meetings, ad hoc meetings, or other ways of coordinating work.

- We will meet during class time to work collaboratively as a group/resolve any issues we may be having on assigned tasks. We will mostly meet outside of class during class allocated time, but will attend class when we have questions for Andy/Selene.  
- We will have meetings every Monday 7:30 pm. This meeting is used to plan our tasks for the upcoming week and discuss our progress. Each person will be assigned a task by our program manager to be worked on within the next few days.
- We will have back-up meetings on Tuesdays/Wednesdays 8:30 pm as necessary based on if more time is needed by team members to complete their assigned tasks.

## Who will own each of the components in your architecture? Owning them means being responsible for writing them and making sure they are functional and correct.

- API - Dayoung
- Bathroom - Beichen
- Map - Naveen
- Side Panel - Katherine
- Input and output - Naveen

## By what date will you have a release candidate?

- June 3rd (a week before the final due date to check for any potential errors/bugs in the app from user testing and feedback from various users)

## What practices will you use to know if you're making progress toward that release candidate?

- We will have weekly meetings to check on our progress
- Our manager will create a minimum of 3 actions items for us to complete at each meeting. Completing those action items will help us show progress
- When we start coding our project, the percentage of requirements completed will indicate our progress

## What practices will you follow to improve your process if it's not working?

- Have more meetings/check-ins to ensure work is getting completed after a few days of it getting assigned to a team member. Team members in our group tend to work best and be more focused when working at an environment of their own (such as at home alone, or in a coffee shop, or on the bed); however, if no progress is shown on assigned tasks, then we will have to enforce more meetings where we all meet and work together in person.  
- Have more meetings/check-ins to ensure work is getting completed after a few days of it getting assigned to a team member
- Discussions 2 times/week to sort through errors/bugs that might hinder the completion of the work
- IF necessary (if some team members are getting absolutely no work done on a weekly basis), daily dedicated group work-time with mandatory attendance from all members
