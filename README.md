# Our Problem Statement:

Have you ever been in a situation where you could not find the bathroom? As a legend (Elmo) once tought us all, when you gotta go, you gotta go! All of us have had potty emergencies but have not always known where the nearest bathroom is. We want to create a solution for those in dire situations when finding a bathroom is necessary.
